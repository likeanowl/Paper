%\boldmath
Software development is a complex process and therefore there are lot of different metodologies created in order to make it easier. Big projects are splitted into modules developed by separated teams of software engineers. Version control systems are used for collaborative development. We believe that version control system's data could be analyzed and dependencies between changes frequency and some issues into software project could be found. This information must be seen by developers and, as some papers point, they are unlikely to search for information somewhere outside the IDE. Therefore, in this work we decided to develop a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA IDE, which will collect data about VCS changes and their frequency and show it right in user interface.
